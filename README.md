# Decision-statements-in-CPP

🎯Aim: To study and implement decision statements in C++.

⚙️Tools: C++ IDE / Visual Studio Code.

💡Theory:
1.	if statement
An ‘if’ statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

2.	if...else statement
An ‘if’ statement can be followed by an optional ‘else’ statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.

3.	switch statement
A ‘switch’ statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

4.	nested if statements
You can use one ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement inside another ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement(s).

5.	nested switch statements
You can use one ‘switch’ statement inside another ‘switch’ statement(s).

✅Conclusion: With the help of the 4 programs we learn to implement decision statemnts like 'if-else' , 'of-else-elif', and switch statemnts.

# Decision-statements-in-CPP

## Aim
To study and implement decision statements in C++.

## Tools
C++ IDE / Visual Studio Code.

## Theory
1.	if statement
An ‘if’ statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

2.	if...else statement
An ‘if’ statement can be followed by an optional ‘else’ statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.

3.	switch statement
A ‘switch’ statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

4.	nested if statements
You can use one ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement inside another ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement(s).

5.	nested switch statements
You can use one ‘switch’ statement inside another ‘switch’ statement(s).

Nested if-else statements are those statements in which there is an if statement inside another if else. We use nested if-else statements when we want to implement multilayer conditions (condition inside the condition inside the condition and so on). C++ allows any number of nesting levels.

### Working of switch Statement
The working of the switch statement in C++ is quite similar to C. Here's how it works:

Evaluate the switch expression: The expression provided in the switch statement is evaluated.
Match with case values: The evaluated value is compared with the values specified in each case block.
Execute the matching case block:
If a matching case value is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.
If no matching case is found, the default case, if provided, is executed.
Use of the break keyword:
If the break keyword is used in a case block, the program exits the switch statement, and the flow continues after the switch.
If there is no break, the program will continue executing subsequent case blocks.
Proceed after the switch: After the switch statement completes, the statements following it are executed.

## Conclusion
With the help of the 4 programs we learn to implement decision statemnts like 'if-else' , 'of-else-elif', and switch statemnts.
